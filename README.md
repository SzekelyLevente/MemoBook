# MemoBook

## Overview
MemoBook is a digital memory book website designed for recording memories, much like a diary. The application is developed in F# using WebSharper technology. Behind the website, there is a MySQL server, which is accessed through an API, allowing data to be stored on a server.

## Motivation
I created this website because I believe it is important that memories are not lost due to the limitations of human memory. In the past, during my parents' time, memory books were very popular, and my mother often told me stories about them. This inspired me to create an application that serves the same purpose.
